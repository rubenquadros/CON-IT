# CON-IT

## Introduction

CON-IT is an indoor position based project which delivers notifications to the users on the basis of their position which is determined using WIFI signal strength.

This has two parts:

1.	An Android APP

This delivers the notifications to the users 

2.	A WEB interface which lets merchants enter their product details

The merchants can enter their product description, offer price and router details.

## Use Case

The best use case would be a shopping mall.

### • WEB Portal

The merchant would register on the WEB portal where he would be required to give the MAC address of his WIFI router.

Once registered the merchant can login to the portal and give the details about his products and offer prices which would be displayed in the mobile application.

There is also an option to change his MAC address in case he has changed his router.

### • Mobile Application

This is a simple Android application which shows the notifications regarding the different offers in the shopping mall based on the users’ position.

The position of the user is determined based on the strength of the WIFI signals and then the notifications are displayed based on this position.
